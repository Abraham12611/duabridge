<Warning>
  All endpoints use HTTPS. HTTP is not supported. API keys that call the API
  over HTTP may be subject to automatic rotation.
</Warning>

All API requests use the following base URL: `https://api.cartesia.ai`. (For WebSockets the corresponding protocol is `wss://`.)

### Always send a `Cartesia-Version` header

Each request you send our API should have a `Cartesia-Version` header containing the date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) when you tested your integration. For WebSockets, you can alternately use the `?cartesia_version` query parameter, which will take precedence.

This will help us provide you with timely deprecation notices and enable us to provide automatic backwards compatibility where possible.

For a given `Cartesia-Version`, we will preserve existing input and output fields, but we may make non-breaking changes, such as:

1. Add optional request fields.
2. Add additional response fields.
3. Change conditions for specific error types
4. Add variants to enum-like output values.

Our versioning scheme is inspired by the [Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/versioning).

### Use API keys to authenticate

Authentication is handled using API keys. You can create a new API key from [play.cartesia.ai/keys](https://play.cartesia.ai/keys).

Client apps making Cartesia API requests should use Access Tokens, to avoid exposing your API Key. Your server generates an Access Token and sends it to your client, which in turn includes `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` in the HTTP headers of Cartesia API requests.
Read the full documentation for this at [Access Token API Reference](/api-reference/auth/access-token) for more info.

For WebSocket connections, authenticate by passing in the field `?api_key=<your_api_key>` when creating the WebSocket connection from the server, and passing in `?access_token=<access_token>` when creating from the client.

### Check response codes

Our API uses standard HTTP response codes; refer to [httpstatuses.io](https://httpstatuses.io).

### Pass data according to the method

All GET requests use query parameters to pass data. All POST requests use a JSON body or `multipart/form-data`.

title: Concurrency and WebSocket Limits
subtitle: Learn about concurrency limits and timeouts with the Cartesia API.
---

Your account is subject to two types of rate limits: WebSocket limits and generation concurrency limits.

## Concurrency limits by subscription plan

Your subscription plan determines how many requests can be processed simultaneously. Sonic Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Ink Speech-to-Text (STT) each have separate concurrency limits with the same values per plan.

| Plan | TTS Concurrent Requests | STT Concurrent Requests |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Free | 2 | 8 |
| Pro | 3 | 12 |
| Startup | 5 | 20 |
| Scale | 15 | 60 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

<Note>
  Sonic (Text-to-Speech) and Ink (Speech-to-Text) services have separate concurrent request limits. For example, if you're on the Scale plan, you can have up to 15 concurrent TTS requests AND 60 concurrent STT requests running simultaneously.
</Note>

## Text-to-Speech (TTS) Concurrency

We measure TTS generation concurrency in terms of the number of unique contexts active at a given time.

- For HTTP endpoints, each request is treated as a separate context and counts toward your concurrency limit. 
- For WebSockets, a unique <code>context_id</code> defines a context—sending additional requests with the same <code>context_id</code> does not increase your concurrency usage. This is because requests to the same context are processed sequentially.

If you exceed your TTS concurrency limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error. You can check your concurrency limit and upgrade it on the playground at [play.cartesia.ai](https://play.cartesia.ai).

### Interpreting concurrency limits

How you interpret your TTS concurrency limit depends on how you're using the Sonic model family.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Conversational use cases">
    For real-time conversational use cases, such as powering voice agents, we've found that the number of parallel conversations you can support is effectively 4X your concurrency limit. This is just a rule of thumb, and depends on the types of conversations you're supporting. You can reach out to us to discuss your specific use case.

    For example, if you have a TTS concurrency limit of 15, you can typically support 60 parallel conversations.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Non-conversational use cases">

    For non-conversational use cases, such as generating speech in batch jobs, there is a more direct relationship between your concurrency limit and the number of parallel generations you can support.

    For example, if you have a TTS concurrency limit of 15, you can typically support 15 parallel TTS generations. You can use a connection pool to ensure you don't exceed your concurrency limit.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### WebSocket limits

<Tip> You don't need to worry about WebSocket limits if you're only using the HTTP API. </Tip>

We limit the number of parallel WebSocket connections to 10X your concurrency limit. For example, if you have a concurrency limit of 15, you can have up to 150 parallel WebSocket connections.

If you exceed your WebSocket limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error on trying to open a new WebSocket connection.

Usually, when users run into WebSocket limits (even at scale), it's because they're not properly closing idle connections. Beyond closing idle connections, you can also create a connection pool to ensure you don't exceed your WebSocket limit.

#### WebSocket timeouts

We close idle WebSocket connections after 5 minutes. We recommend closing and re-opening a new websocket connection when connections stay idle longer than 5 minutes.

## Speech-to-Text (STT) Concurrency

Each active transcription stream counts as one concurrent request, regardless of whether you're using HTTP or WebSocket connections.

- One stream equals one HTTP or WebSocket connection
- Each concurrent transcription counts toward your STT concurrency limit

If you exceed your STT concurrency limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

### If you want to generate speech in real-time

We recommend using our WebSocket endpoint for real-time applications for a few reasons:

1. **Latency**: You can establish a WebSocket connection in advance, which means that you do not incur any connection latency when you start generating speech. (This usually saves you about 200ms.)
2. **Input Streaming**: You can stream in inputs while maintaining the prosody of the generated speech, which is useful when generating text inputs in real-time, such as with an LLM.
3. **Timestamps**: You can get timestamped transcripts for the generated speech to build features like subtitles or live transcripts. (For the `sonic` model, timestamps are only supported for languages `en`, `de`, `es`, and `fr`. For `sonic-preview`, timestamps are supported for all languages!)
4. **Multiplexing**: You can multiplex multiple conversations over a single connection.

### If you want to generate speech ahead of time

We recommend using our raw bytes (i.e. audio file) output endpoint, which can give you outputs in a variety of formats, such as WAV and MP3 (in addition to raw PCM audio).

This endpoint creates a bidirectional WebSocket connection. The connection supports multiplexing, so you can send multiple requests and receive the corresponding responses in parallel.

The WebSocket API is built around contexts:

When you send a generation request, you pass a context_id. Further inputs on the same context_id will continue the generation, maintaining prosody.
Responses for a context contain the context_id you passed in so that you can match requests and responses.
Read the guide on working with contexts to learn more.

For the best performance, we recommend the following usage pattern:

Do many generations over a single WebSocket. Just use a separate context for each generation. The WebSocket scales up to dozens of concurrent generations.
Set up the WebSocket before the first generation. This ensures you don’t incur latency when you start generating speech.
Include necessary spaces and punctuation: This allows Sonic to generate speech more accurately and with better prosody.
Use max_buffer_delay_ms to let the model intelligently manage buffering up to the specified maximum delay.
For conversational agent use cases, we recommend the following usage pattern:

Each turn in a conversation should correspond to a context: For example, if you are using Sonic to power a voice agent, each turn in the conversation should be a new context.
Start a new context for interruptions: If the user interrupts the agent, start a new context for the agent’s response.
To learn more about managing concurrent generations and WebSocket connection limits, see the concurrency limits and timeouts page.

When set, the model will buffer incoming text chunks until it’s confident it has enough context to generate high-quality speech, or the buffer delay elapses, whichever comes first. Without this option set, the model will kick off generations immediately, ceding control of buffering to the user.

> In many real time use cases, you don't have your transcripts available upfront—like when you're generating them using an LLM. For these cases, Sonic supports input streaming.

The context IDs you pass to the Cartesia API identify speech contexts. Contexts maintain prosody between their inputs—so you can send a transcript in multiple parts and receive seamless speech in return.

To stream in inputs on a context, just pass a `continue` flag (set to `true`) for every input that you expect will be followed by more inputs. (By default, this flag is set to `false`.)

To finish a context, just set `continue` to `false`. If you do not know the last transcript in advance, you can send an input with an empty transcript and `continue` set to `false`.

<Note>Contexts automatically expire 1 second after the last audio output is streamed out. Attempting to send another input on the same context ID after expiry is not supported.</Note>

<ParamField body="continue" type="boolean" default={false}>
    Whether this input may be followed by more inputs.
</ParamField>

### Input Format

1. Inputs on the same context must keep all fields except `transcript`, `continue`, and `duration` the same.
2. Transcripts are concatenated verbatim, so make sure they form a valid transcript when joined together. Make sure to include any spaces between words or punctuations as necessary. For example, in languages with spaces, you should include a space at the end of the preceding transcript, e.g. transcript 1 is `Thanks for coming, ` and transcript 2 is `it was great to see you.`

### Example

Let's say you're trying to generate speech for "Hello, Sonic! I'm streaming inputs." You should stream in the following inputs (repeated fields omitted for brevity). Note: all other fields (e.g. `model_id`, `language`) are required and should be passed unchanged between requests with input streaming.

```json Input Streaming
{"transcript": "Hello, Sonic!", "continue": true, "context_id": "happy-monkeys-fly"}
{"transcript": " I'm streaming ", "continue": true, "context_id": "happy-monkeys-fly"}
{"transcript": "inputs.", "continue": false, "context_id": "happy-monkeys-fly"}
```

<Tip>
If [streaming in input tokens](/build-with-cartesia/capability-guides/stream-inputs-using-continuations), we recommend using `max_buffer_delay_ms`, which sets the maximum time the model will buffer text before starting generation.

Without this option set, the model will start generating immediately on the first request, giving you full control over buffering of inputs.
</Tip>

If you don't know the last transcript in advance, you can send an input with an empty transcript and `continue` set to `false`:

```json Input Streaming
{"transcript": "Hello, Sonic!", "continue": true, "context_id": "happy-monkeys-fly"}
{"transcript": " I'm streaming ", "continue": true, "context_id": "happy-monkeys-fly"}
{"transcript": "inputs.", "continue": true, "context_id": "happy-monkeys-fly"}
{"transcript": "", "continue": false, "context_id": "happy-monkeys-fly"}
```

### Output

You will only receive `done: true` after outputs for the entire context have been returned.

Outputs for a given context will always be in order of the inputs you streamed in. (That is, if you send input A and then input B on a context, you will first receive the chunks corresponding to input A, and then the chunks corresponding to input B.)

## Cancelling Requests
You may also cancel outgoing requests through the websocket.

To cancel a request, send a JSON message with the following structure:

```json WebSocket Request
{
  "context_id": "happy-monkeys-fly",
  "cancel": true
}
```

When you send a cancel request:

1. It will only halt requests that have not begun generating a response yet.
2. Any currently generating request will continue sending responses until completion.

<Note>
The `context_id` in the cancel request should match the `context_id` of the request you want to cancel.
</Note>

title: Context Flushing and Flush IDs
subtitle: Learn about managing multiple transcript generations with context flushing.
---

## Overview

When using [context IDs with the WebSocket API](/2024-06-10/api-reference/tts/working-with-web-sockets/contexts), all audio chunks for transcripts submitted to a single context share the same context ID. This makes it difficult to determine which audio chunks correspond to specific transcript submissions.

While this behavior works well for streaming audio, some implementations require the ability to map audio chunks back to their originating transcripts.

<Frame caption="Flushing allows you to convert N transcripts into N generators." background="subtle">
    <img src="file:d6e42e33-eb4a-4037-b620-2b3e70a479e7" alt="context_flushing" />
</Frame>

## Manual Flushing

Manual flushing creates clear boundaries between transcript submissions within the same context.

### How It Works

Each time you trigger a manual flush, the system increments a `flush_id` counter. This ID is included in corresponding response audio chunk payloads, allowing you to track which transcript generated specific audio chunks.

### Implementation

To trigger a manual flush:

1. Send a request with these parameters:
   - `continue=True` (indicates you're continuing with the same context)
   - `flush=True` (triggering the flush operation)
   - Empty transcript
   - Same context ID as your previous request

### Example Flow

```
1. Submit transcript 1 on context 1
2. Flush context 1
3. Submit transcript 2 on context 1
```

In this flow:
- All audio chunks from transcript 1 will have `flush_id=1`
- The manual flush increments the ID
- All audio chunks from transcript 2 will have `flush_id=2`

## Payload Structure

Each audio chunk payload includes a `flush_id` field that serves as a transcript identifier. This ID increments with each manual flush operation, creating a clear boundary between transcript submissions.

## When to Use Manual Flushing

Consider using manual flushing when:
- You need to associate audio chunks with their originating transcripts
- Your application architecture expects a one-to-one relationship between transcripts and response streams
- You're integrating with frameworks that assume each transcript has a corresponding generator

This feature is particularly helpful when using multiple providers, as it aligns the Cartesia API with systems that expect discrete generator responses per transcript.

Generate audio that smoothly connects two existing audio segments. This is useful for inserting new speech between existing speech segments while maintaining natural transitions.

The cost is 1 credit per character of the infill text plus a fixed cost of 300 credits.

Infilling is only available on sonic-2 at this time.

At least one of left_audio or right_audio must be provided.

As with all generative models, there’s some inherent variability, but here’s some tips we recommend to get the best results from infill:

Use longer infill transcripts
This gives the model more flexibility to adapt to the rest of the audio
Target natural pauses in the audio when deciding where to clip
This means you don’t need word-level timestamps to be as precise
Clip right up to the start and end of the audio segment you want infilled, keeping as much silence in the left/right audio segments as possible
This helps the model generate more natural transitions
